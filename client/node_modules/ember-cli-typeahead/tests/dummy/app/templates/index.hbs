<h2 id='title'>Ember Typeahead component</h2>
<p>This component is based on <a href="https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js">Twitter's typeahead (v0.10.2)</a>.
 It only makes use of the jquery plugin (not Bloodhound) and leaves the
 implementation up to the developer.<br/>
 Note: The stylesheet comes straight from the above link.</p>


<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>This demo uses Ember's documentation as the feed. It searches all titles and shows
   a maximum of 5 in the dropdown. Selecting one will open a new window and display
   the relevant page.</p>

<h3>List of countries</h3>
{{type-ahead class="typeahead" placeholder="Search countries"
             name="countries" highlight=true
             content=content}}
